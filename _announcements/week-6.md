title: Software Development Process  
week: 6
date: 2025-02-10

As part of software development process, each team is expected to use a structured development process, including pull requests, code reviews, etc. Each team will also submit sprint reports, individual surveys, and have weekly meetings with TA Mentor. The development process started last week (as you started developing your project plan) and the required "process-related" submissions will start this week. 

Here are important submissions to remember for upcoming weeks:
* Every week all members of a team are expected to meet with their mentor for a regularly scheduled meeting. Weekly Canvas assignments will help track your attendance for these meetings.
* Every week each student is expected to complete one (Confidential, Peer Evaluation) Survey by Wednesday noon. The link can be found under the Canvas assignment which will help track if you completed the survey or not. 
* At the end of each sprint, each team will submit a sprint report (and retrospective) through a Canvas assignment.
* TAs will also review your github commits, PRs, code reviews regularly and will keep an eye on appropriate division of labor within the project team. They will also provide you a weekly assessment of your work.

These assignments are required for weeks 6, 8, 10-14 and count towards "project process" part of the project which is worth 20% of the overall project grade.
